- methodological
- technological
- biological

subdomains:
  conceptual.definition:
    - Exposomics as discovery-driven research program (not just synonym for "environment")
    - Complementary to genomics, comprehensive analysis of exposures and responses
  methodological.approach:
    - Discovery-driven vs hypothesis-driven research
    - Integration of fragmented research silos (disease-specific or exposure-specific)
  technological.needs:
    - Mass spectrometry (targeted vs untargeted), causal inference algorithms
    - Cohorts, data platforms, new omics assays
  biological.responses:
    - Internal body processes: inflammation, metabolism, hormones
    - Multi-omics biomarkers
