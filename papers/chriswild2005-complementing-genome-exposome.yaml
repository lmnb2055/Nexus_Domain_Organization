subdomains:
  chemical.carcinogens:
    - Genotoxic chemicals (DNA/protein adducts)
    - Aflatoxin (urinary biomarkers, liver cancer risk)
    - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH-DNA adducts, lung cancer)
    - Arylamine-hemoglobin adducts (bladder cancer)
  biological.infections:
    - Viral/bacterial exposures (hepatitis B, H. pylori, HPV)
    - Antibody biomarkers for infection-related cancers
  biological.omics:
    - Transcriptomics (mRNA response to radiation, estrogens)
    - Proteomics (biomarkers in cancer epidemiology)
    - Metabolomics (metabolite fingerprints, dietary exposures, infection response)
  methodological.exposure:
    - Exposure biomarkers (chemical-specific, susceptibility, mechanistic)
    - Prospective cohort studies, repeated sampling
    - Data analysis challenges (high variability, need for bioinformatics)
